Follow these steps to set up and run the MyCart app locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **npm**
- **SQLite** (or a compatible database for storing pricing data)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jatindahiya027/MyCart.git
   cd MyCart
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and configure the required variables:
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=Your Email
   EMAIL_PASS=Your Email password or App password if you have 2 factor authentication
   ```
   Go to [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) and create a new App Password.

4. **Run Database setup**:
   Set up the SQLite database:
   ```bash
   node createdb.js
   node enterdata.js
   node createindex.mjs
   ```
5. **Install Redis**:
   To use Redis locally, you'll need to install Redis on your machine, configure it, and then interact with it using a Redis client in your application. Here‚Äôs how you can set up Redis locally:

    - ### **Step 1: Install Redis Locally**

    - #### **On macOS** (via Homebrew):
    1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already: [Homebrew installation guide](https://brew.sh).
    2. Install Redis using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install redis
   ```
    3. Start Redis:
     ```bash
     brew services start redis
     ```

    - #### **On Linux** (via APT):
    1. Update the package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
    2. Install Redis:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install redis-server
   ```
    3. Start Redis:
   ```bash
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

    - #### **On Windows**:
    1. Download and install Redis for Windows from [Redis on Windows](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases).
    2. After installation, start Redis by running `redis-server.exe` from the command prompt.

    - **Check Redis Status**:
     - You can check if Redis is running by using the `redis-cli` command.
     - Run `redis-cli` and type `ping`. If Redis is running, it will respond with `PONG`.
    - Make sure redis is running on port **6379**.

6. **Install Python and dependencies**:
    Install Selenium for Python [installation guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-selenium-in-python/) 
7. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

8. Open the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

9. ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
10. Open the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3027](http://localhost:3027).
